# With this option enabled ClamAV will try to detect phishing attempts by using
# signatures.
# Default: yes
PhishingSignatures yes

# Scan URLs found in mails for phishing attempts using heuristics.
# Default: yes
PhishingScanURLs yes

# Always block SSL mismatches in URLs, even if the URL isn't in the database.
# This can lead to false positives.
#
# Default: no
#PhishingAlwaysBlockSSLMismatch no

# Always block cloaked URLs, even if URL isn't in database.
# This can lead to false positives.
#
# Default: no
#PhishingAlwaysBlockCloak no

# Allow heuristic match to take precedence.
# When enabled, if a heuristic scan (such as phishingScan) detects
# a possible virus/phish it will stop scan immediately. Recommended, saves CPU
# scan-time.
# When disabled, virus/phish detected by heuristic scans will be reported only at
# the end of a scan. If an archive contains both a heuristically detected
# virus/phish, and a real malware, the real malware will be reported
#
# Keep this disabled if you intend to handle "*.Heuristics.*" viruses
# differently from "real" malware.
# If a non-heuristically-detected virus (signature-based) is found first,
# the scan is interrupted immediately, regardless of this config option.
#
# Default: no
#HeuristicScanPrecedence yes
